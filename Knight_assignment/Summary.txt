Summary:
1.Model Used: Random forest classifier
2.designation,province,country,review_title,region_1,region_2,price are the features used for training.Because I got good training accuracy with these features only in predicting variety.
3.Model accuracy in train: Training Accuracy is 70%
4.Insights :
  1.Variety is independent on user_name(same user gave different responses for some same values)
  2.Variety is independent on winery( for some winery it is not the same variety almost all the time)
  3.Variety is independent on points(rating points are not same for the same variety which are the given by the users)
  4.Variety is independent on review_description(for the same variety, there are different reviews and of varying sizes also)
  5.Variety is dependent on price(almost all times same variety has same price)
Note: Look at final.csv in data folder for the predicted variety of the test.csv
