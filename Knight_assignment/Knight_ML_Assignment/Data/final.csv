@paulgwine ,US,Brittan Vineyards 2014 Gestalt Block Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"This black-fruited offering has the winery's signature stamp all over it, with a vein of herb and wet rock that slices through the aromas and into the palate.

@vboone,US,Williams Selyem 2012 Eastside Road Neighbors Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Since this is the winery's largest production Pinot, but still under 1,000 cases, buyers actually have a chance of finding this full-bodied beauty. Sly on the nose, it is tense in toasty oak and chewy cherry, venturing into black cherry, blackberry and root beer. It's amply structured and robust, yet with silky tannins.

@gordone_cellars,US,Cuda Ridge Wines 2013 Reserve Malbec (Livermore Valley),"This wine tastes concentrated and powerful, from the first whiff of spicy cedar and black pepper to the smoky, dried fruit flavors and mouth-coating texture.

Yet while bold and assertive, its alcohol is restrained.",Reserve,90,55.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Cuda Ridge Wines,Pinot Noir

@vboone,US,Williams Selyem 2014 Precious Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From an organic, dry farmed vineyard, this wine is as feral as the forest—a study in wild boar, wildflowers and dried herbs.

@vboone,US,Cedarville Vineyard 2008 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (El Dorado),"This is a very fairly priced Cabernet given its quality.

@paulgwine ,US,Mount Baker 2007 Barrel Select Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This “Barrel Select” Syrah has been ripened to pruneyness, yet remains short, hot and simple.

@wawinereport,US,Pirouette 2013 Vintage Select Solo Dancer Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Although not labeled as such, this is 98% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Petit Verdot.

@mattkettmann,US,Testarossa 2012 Cuvée Los Gatos Chardonnay (Monterey County),"Los Gatos-based Testarossa is building a powerful reputation as a single-vineyard specialist, but this more accessibly priced cuvée from Monterey County rivals their best efforts.

@paulgwine ,US,Efeste 2009 Jolie Bouche Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This is a supple, spicy wine, with a core of black cherry fruit. It's complemented with lighter flavors of cola, earth and coffee.

@paulgwine ,US,Trisaetum 2013 Ribbon Ridge Estate Dry Riesling (Ribbon Ridge),"This dry wine from the Ribbon Ridge vineyard, adjacent to the winery, is briskly tart without being sour. Flavors of lemony tea and Meyer lemon meringue intrigue immediately. There is splendid structure and complexity in play here, with layers of flower, citrus and mineral, all in perfect harmony.

@paulgwine ,US,Blakeslee 2014 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"One of the top Pinot rosés of the vintage, this is beautiful to look at, to sniff and to sip. The color of pale pink cherry blossoms, it matches rather delicate complexity to surprising concentration, pushing ripe cherry fruit front and center. It's finished dry, and should not be over-chilled, or you'll miss the lovely aromatics.",Rosé of,91,30.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Blakeslee,Pinot Noir
@paulgwine ,US,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2010 Ethos Reserve Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Black fruits are wreathed in subtle notes of earth, smoke and graphite.

Michelle,Chardonnay
@paulgwine ,US,Columbia Crest 2007 Grand Estates Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a changed wine from previous vintages, now emphasizing the berry flavors of the fruit and not shying away from some chewy tannins.

@paulgwine ,US,Colene Clemens 2012 Margo Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Bright and spicy, this wine makes an immediate impact. The blueberry fruit has a sassy edge, and it penetrates through the middle into a finish with notes of black licorice, baking spices and coffee grounds. Firm, full and tight, the wine should age nicely now through 2025.",Margo,92,36.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Colene Clemens,Pinot Noir

@vboone,US,Klinker Brick 2008 Farrah Syrah (Lodi),"From a producer to watch in underrated Lodi, this intense, black cherry, bacon-fat and white peppery Syrah has an almost peat-like, whisky aroma at first, very inviting, which then leads into more bacon and pepper that carries through on the palate, balanced by extremely smooth tannins and an unexpected elegance.

@mattkettmann,US,Midnight 2013 Starlight Sangiovese (Paso Robles),"Light and lively aromas of dried red berries, concentrated roses, cola and black plums show on the nose of this very accessible and pleasurable Sangiovese.

@vboone,US,Zepaltas 2012 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This wine pushes the limits of what is commonly thought of as California Chardonnay.

@mattkettmann,US,Sante Arcangeli 2014 Lester Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"There's an inherent minerality to this bottling.

@paulgwine ,US,Amalie Robert 2012 Wadenswil Clone Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Medium weight and roundly fruity, this pleasant wine carries a touch of minerality.

@wawinereport,US,Coeur d'Alene 2012 Scarlet Lake Syrah (Washington),"This directly appealing wine has notes of fresh blueberry pie, char and barrel spices.

@paulgwine ,US,Cristom 2014 Marjorie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),This matches deep purple fruits to aggressive herb and stem flavors.

@paulgwine ,US,J. Christopher 2014 Nuages Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This cuvée is principally from the estate (Appassionata) vineyard.

@wineschach,US,Elk Cove 1998 La Boheme Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"There’s a high-wire pungency to this slightly rustic single-vineyard offering that shows notes of smoked meat, molasses, rhubarb and tar. If any one thing carries the nose it’s some burnt popcorn. The fruity palate is jammy and hard-driving. This one is about robust berry fruit rather than nuance.

@paulgwine ,US,Coeur d'Alene 2005 Opulence Syrah (Washington),"Opulence is the winery's reserve Syrah, and it is a robust, tooth-staining wine that takes no prisoners. Dense scents suggest a pig roast on a pile of licorice sticks; the aromas are almost visceral. The fruit has been very well handled and the tannins, though full and powerful, have been polished to a satiny sheen. There's a little chalkiness to the finish, perhaps from acidification, but that may well resolve with a little more bottle age.",Opulence,91,40.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Coeur d'Alene,Syrah

But one can't help but wonder if shipping fruit all the way down the coast might bang it up a bit. For whatever reason, this wine tastes fractured, metallic and chalky.

@gordone_cellars,US,Prospect 772 2012 The Brawler Syrah (Calaveras County),"This luscious, flavorful and mouthcoatingly rich wine smells like ripe strawberries, and tastes almost like blackberry jam.

@gordone_cellars,US,Seven Deadly Zins 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"This all-out Zin makes no bones about its sweetness, heavy oak spiciness and full body.

@vboone,US,Gloria Ferrer NV Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Carneros),"Introduced by a lively, crisp mousse, this 100% Chardonnay sparkler is made méthode Champenoise, and dry.

@vboone,US,MacPhail 2012 Gap's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Steely and intense in baked pear and pineapple, this white from a well-known vineyard more often associated with Pinot Noir offers contrast in a quality package. On the one hand, it's bright and vibrant, and on the other, there's a richness of caramel and oak, the wine coming in like a lion, out like a lamb.
